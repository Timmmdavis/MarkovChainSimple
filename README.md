## Introduction

### Simple MCMC code written in MATLAB (with examples)

This code is a MCMC code. Can be used to invert surface deformation with elastic models etc. 
Contains: 
* Saving during runs (backs up reuslts on the fly)
* Multiple chains
* Visualisation as the MCMC progresses (see the posterior update in real time)
* Examples to see how to run and use this code

## 1. How to run
